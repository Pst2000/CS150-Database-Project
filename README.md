## Logistics

Please type your Chinese name and ID.

* Your Name: 彭绍庭 郑瑜婷
* Your ID: 2018533245 2018533089

*If you are a team, please write names and IDs of both people.*

**Due date:** 23:59，January, 10th, 2020.

You need to finish an entire machine learning system on provided dataset. You do not need to implement a machine learning algorithm from scratch, you are free to call any existing libraries for data science.

## Submission

You need to submit three parts.

- Submit the report to **gradescope**
  -  To form a team, remember to select your teammate when you are submitting at gradescope.
- Submit the completed test.csv to **gradescope**
  -  To form a team, remember to select your teammate when you are submitting at gradescope.
- Submit your codes to the github classroom repository.

### Report

A report at most 4-page to describle the entire pipeline of your work. You should use the provided the report template, follow the guideline and instructions given in the template and fill into the corresponding part.

### Answers of the rest in testset

We'll only offer a subset of correct answers for test data. To submit your results, you should complete the missing values of Correct First Attempt in ***test.csv***, which means replace NaN with the value your model predicts. Then you need to submit your completed ***test.csv***. (Don't submit train.csv.)

**Note: For those who don't obey our submission rules, we'll give it 0 point. If you have any question about this, post it on Piazza.**

### Codes

You also need to upload your codes with an introduction file. We'll do duplicate checking for all the submitted codes, so don't copy other people's codes.

*Bonus*: We'll offer additional points for those using PySpark to implement the algorithms. To earn the bonus, state clearly in the report about your implementation.
